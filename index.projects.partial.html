  <h2>432 Broadway</h2>
  <h3>12 SEPTEMBER, 2023</h3>
  <p>
    In this completed lighting design project, we've orchestrated a harmonious
    interplay of ceiling and floor lamps to illuminate and elevate the ambiance
    of a living room space. Through thoughtful consideration of both form and
    function, Prizma Studio has crafted a lighting design that not only meets
    the practical needs of the space but also enhances its aesthetic appeal.
